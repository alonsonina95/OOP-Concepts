# Notes of OOP concepts vs Procedural Programming
## Structured programming
- First: identify which algorithm to manipulate data
- Why? Small problems are easily resolved with a procedural implementation (straight down, line by line)
- Why not? Because it scales very poorly
- As the program grows in size, its complexity increases
- Testing a single aspect becomes nearly impossible

## Why do we use OOP?
- Large problems can be more easily scaled using OOP paradigm
- OOP allows users to break problems down into small logical objects
- OOP allows users to view code-details within the context of a specific object
- OOP allows user to more easily debug code
- OOP allows greater testability of code

## An object-oriented program is made of objects
- Each object has specific functionalities, which users access via the object's methods
- The OOP paradigm suggests that a programmer will
	- First; identify which structures (objects) to manipulate data
	- Second; identify what algorithms each structure will use

## 3 Aspects of an object
- Identity: What is the location?
- State = What does it store?
- Behavior = How does it act?

## What are classes?
- Template or blueprint from which objects are made

## What is the difference between reference vs value types?
- Reference types are objects that store references to the actual data -> Class, interfaces, string
- Value Types hold value => Structs, Enums, Boolean, Numeric types

## What is an interface? (implements)
